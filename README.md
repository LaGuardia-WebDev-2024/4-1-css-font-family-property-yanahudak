## Directions 
### Step #1 - Change the font families <br>
This webpage displays the theme songs from a few famous TV families. Each of the lyrics paragraphs have id's, but the CSS rules for them have no properties yet. Add a font-family property to each of the CSS rules, using a generic family name that works for all computers. Choose a different font family for each rule.<br><br>
Here's a list of generic font families: sans-serif, serif, fantasy, monospace, and cursive.
<br><br>
### Step #2 - Change the base font family <br>
Remember how to use element selectors from CSS Basics? Use the body selector to make a new CSS rule that changes the font-family of the entire page.
